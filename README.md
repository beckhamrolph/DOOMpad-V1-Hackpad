# Inspiration
I have seen the trend of downloading a simplified version of the popular DOOM game on unconventional objects. I decided I would like to continue this trend by creating a Hackpad to run it aswell. 
# Challenges
The game DOOM was not originally meant to run on a microcontroller such as the XIAO. Therefore the code needs a massive overhaul to work with this sort of interface. Luckily, this project has been done with similar boards such as the original RP2040. Some minor re-working of the code should allow the game to run.
